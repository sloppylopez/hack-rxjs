# RxJS hackaton

After the great introduction of RxJS from our friends at  Reactive Amsterdam  we decided to keep studying!  

We meet to hack together some code to experiment with [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/). 

Reactive Extensions defined a fundamental interaction pattern for your APIs that expand on the Observer Pattern to allow for asynchronous, just in time processing of data as it becomes available, as well as enabling back pressure and thus paving the way described by the Reactive Manifesto.

We spent some quality nerd time by hacking together on a few sample projects to study RxJS and how to apply it to our daily JS development tasks.

## Add your sample
To add a sample just create a folder in the root with an explanatory name and the content of the sample and a short explain the goal of the excercise.

├── README.md <br/>
├── index.html<br/>
├── index.js<br/>
└── ...<br/>

#### Rules
 * Add a README.md file containing a short description of the exercise
 * When is possible use CDN for external libs
 * When is not possible add the information to add the library in the README file
 * Try to use external media file (jpg, png, etc..) using link to the source. Don't add big file to the project.


## Resources
 * [reactivex.io](http://reactivex.io/) The official websit
 * [rxmarbles.com](rxmarbles.com) Interactive diagrams of Rx Observables

 
Add here other resources.
